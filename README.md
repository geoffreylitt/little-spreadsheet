# little spreadsheet

This is a small spreadsheet in a web browser. I made it so I could learn more about building spreadsheets, and play with some new ideas for extending them.

This implementation is inspired by, and in parts directly based on:

* [David Albert's spreadsheet.js](https://github.com/davidbalbert/spreadsheet.js)
* The book Spreadsheet Implementation Technology, by Peter Sestoft

## Running it

```
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```
